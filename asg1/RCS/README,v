2 This program was completed using pair programming.\
3 Partner: Cedric Linares (cslinare@@ucsc.edu)\
4 Partner: Kevin Cai (kcai2@@ucsc.edu)\
5\
6 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should\
7 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and\
8 at most 25% of an individual\'92s effort for an assignment should\
9 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer\
10 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work\
11 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into\
12 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.\
