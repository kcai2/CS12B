This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Adam Paz (apa10@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Kevin Cai (kcai2@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
Adam Paz spent ___4_ hours working alone.
Kevin Cai spent __1__ hours working alone.
We spent __20__ hours working together.
Adam Paz spent __13__ hours driving.
Kevin Cai spent ___7_ hours driving.
